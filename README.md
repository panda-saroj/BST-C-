# BST-C-
 C++ Program To Implement BST  * Insert  * Check BST or Not  * Preorder, Postorder and Inorder Traversal

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties 
âˆ’ The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key. 
- The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.

This C++ program provides options
- To Insert nodes to the tree
- Preorder, Postorder and Inorder Traversal
- Given a tree checking BST or Not
